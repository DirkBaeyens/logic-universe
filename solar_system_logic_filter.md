## üåû STEP 1: Core Basics of Today‚Äôs Solar System Science

Here are the generally accepted pillars of Solar System knowledge:

### üåê Modern Solar System Science (Top 10 Concepts)
1. **The Sun formed from a collapsing cloud of gas (Solar Nebula Theory)**
2. **Planets formed from accretion of dust and gas**
3. **Inner planets are rocky, outer ones are gas giants (planetary differentiation)**
4. **Gravitational forces determine planetary motion (Kepler/Newton)**
5. **Moons formed from debris or were captured**
6. **Asteroids and comets are leftover building blocks**
7. **The Sun produces energy by nuclear fusion (hydrogen to helium)**
8. **The solar system is stable but slowly evolving**
9. **Solar wind shapes planetary magnetospheres and tails**
10. **Planetary atmospheres evolve due to radiation, volcanism, and impacts**

| # | Concept | Status | Reasoning |
|----|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Solar Nebula Theory** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental (25%) | Not directly observable; too linear and heat-dominated; lacks cold-fuel counterpart. |
| 2 | **Planet Accretion** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (25%) | Explains clustering, but ignores long-term balance or external forces like cold flows. |
| 3 | **Rocky/Gas Giant Separation** | ‚úÖ Balanced (50%) | Observable and cyclic in solar formation logic; can align with balance zones. |
| 4 | **Gravitational Motion** | ‚úÖ Core Logic (25%) | Proven, observable, and stable; fits basic universal motion rule. |
| 5 | **Moon Formation** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed (25%) | Still debated; capture theories are not always balanced or provable. |
| 6 | **Asteroids & Comets** | ‚úÖ Useful Core (25%) | Observed and logical remnants; could hold memory of early or balanced processes. |
| 7 | **Solar Fusion (H‚ÜíHe)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Review (25%) | May work, but ignores cold inflows, external balancing, or alternative energy systems. |
| 8 | **Slow Evolution** | ‚úÖ Balanced (50%) | Supports adaptive change, long-term shifts, aligns with long-cycle logic. |
| 9 | **Solar Wind Effects** | ‚úÖ Logical (25%) | Observable and consistent; fits well into cause-effect patterns. |
| 10 | **Atmospheric Evolution** | ‚úÖ Balanced (50%) | Matches known logic of external/internal influence and balance shifts.
