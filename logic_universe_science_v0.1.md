## üî∑ STRUCTURE

We will sort all concepts into 3 categories:
- ‚úÖ **Accepted Core (25%)** ‚Äì stable, logic-confirmed knowledge
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Balanced Systems (50%)** ‚Äì adaptable, balance-seeking processes
- üîç **Experimental or Unbalanced (25%)** ‚Äì incomplete, unstable, or unverified assumptions

## ‚úÖ 1. CORE ACCEPTED LOGIC (25%)

These principles form the *stable core* of our new science, confirmed by logic and observation:

| Domain | Concept |
|--------|---------|
| Astronomy | Cycles of stellar evolution (birth ‚Üí death) |
| Astronomy | Observable gravitational lensing and motion |
| Solar System | Gravitational orbits and planetary motion |
| Solar System | Asteroids and comets as remnants |
| Solar System | Solar wind and magnetospheric interactions |
| Earth | Earthquakes and volcanoes due to tectonics |
| Earth | Measurable human impact on climate and ecosystems |
| Earth | Atmospheric composition and change over time |

üß† These become our **Logic Universe Ground Truths**.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è 2. BALANCED SYSTEMS (50%)

These are processes that follow **balance-seeking or cyclical logic**, and are open to refinement:

| Domain | Concept |
|--------|---------|
| Astronomy | Galactic formation and slow transformation |
| Astronomy | Redshift as a motion/time indicator (partially) |
| Solar System | Rocky/gas planet differentiation |
| Solar System | Planetary atmospheres evolving with radiation/impacts |
| Solar System | Long-term evolution of the solar system |
| Earth | Plate tectonics and layered Earth structure |
| Earth | Water and carbon cycles (self-regulating systems) |

üå± These are the **Adaptive Layers** of Logic Science‚Äîchangeable, but within logic flow.

---

## üîç 3. EXPERIMENTAL / UNBALANCED (25%)

These are **incomplete or flawed** ideas that require logic realignment or deeper testing:

| Domain | Concept |
|--------|---------|
| Astronomy | Big Bang as an origin point (not cyclical) |
| Astronomy | Dark matter and energy as placeholder terms |
| Solar System | Nebular collapse as singular cause of solar system |
| Solar System | Fusion-only sun energy model (ignores cold inflow, balance) |
| Earth | Core-only magnetic field explanation |
| Earth | Natural selection without environmental synchrony |
| Earth | Surface-only (solar-only) energy models |

‚ö†Ô∏è These form the **Reserve Data Pool**‚Äîfor alternative research and logic evolution.
