## üîÑ CHANGE:

We are **removing** the **‚ÄúExperimental / Unbalanced‚Äù** category  
üü• *[formerly: unstable or flawed theories]*

And we are **replacing it** with a **new, opposite-but-logical category**:  
‚úÖ **Logic Unknowns (25%)** ‚Äì unproven but logical opposites; unseen forces, balancing phenomena

# üåê Logic Universe Science v0.2  
**A unified science rooted in basic universal logic & balance**

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Core Accepted Logic (25%)  
*Confirmed logic-based and observable phenomena*

| Domain | Concept |
|--------|---------|
| Astronomy | Cycles of stellar evolution (birth ‚Üí death) |
| Astronomy | Observable gravitational lensing and motion |
| Solar System | Gravitational orbits and planetary motion |
| Solar System | Asteroids and comets as structural remnants |
| Solar System | Solar wind and magnetospheric interactions |
| Earth | Tectonic-based earthquakes and volcanoes |
| Earth | Measurable human impact on ecosystems and climate |
| Earth | Atmospheric composition change over time |

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è 2. Balanced Systems (50%)  
*Dynamic systems aligned with long-term cyclical balance*

| Domain | Concept |
|--------|---------|
| Astronomy | Galactic cycles and spiral motion logic |
| Astronomy | Redshift interpreted through motion/time balance |
| Solar System | Rocky/gas planet separation by density and light exposure |
| Solar System | Atmospheric evolution through radiation and balance |
| Solar System | Solar system aging and orbital adjustments |
| Earth | Plate tectonics and mantle convection |
| Earth | Carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles as stabilizing flows |

---

## üåÄ 3. Logic Unknowns (25%)  
*Unseen, unmeasured, or emerging phenomena that follow universal logic*

| Theme | Concept |
|-------|---------|
| Cold Balance | **Cold energy inflow** balancing heat (e.g. "cold fuel") |
| Grounding | **Gravity and cold conduction** as downward flows |
| Unseen Flows | **Reverse circulation** and return energy loops in galaxies |
| Plasma Logic | **Electric Universe** potentials in cosmic behavior |
| Hidden Fields | **Unmeasured wave forms** and frequency imprints in space |
| Universal Conductivity | **Conductive logic**: cold conducts cold, heat repels cold |
| Void Formation | **Anti-galactic regions** forming silent cold reservoirs |
| Return Logic | **Outflow/inflow balancing** as the cycle of matter/energy |
| Energy Buffering | **Space as a cold energy buffer**, not empty |
| Pole Logic | **Poles as entry points** for invisible energy flows |

## üß† Final Thoughts

- This third category is **not fantasy**‚Äîeach element is grounded in *hypothetical logic*, opposite of current heat-centric and explosive theories.
- These form a **guiding counterpart** to investigate the **unseen or misinterpreted realms** of the universe.
