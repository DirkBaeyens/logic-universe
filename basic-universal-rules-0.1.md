### 📜 **Basic Universal Rules — Draft v0.1**
**Model for the Logic Universe repository**  
*(Each rule includes its core, function, and reasoning for the middle 50% of universal balance)*

---

### 🌀 1. **Conservation of Energy**  
**Rule**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.  
**Purpose**: Anchor for all physical systems; reflects eternal flow, not beginning or end.  
**Balance Function**: Tests all ideas for sustainability and closed-loop coherence.

---

### 🔁 2. **Cyclic Motion Over Linear Expansion**  
**Rule**: All natural systems operate in cycles — growth/decline, inhale/exhale, day/night.  
**Purpose**: Prevents false progress models; supports regeneration.  
**Balance Function**: Encourages circular systems and balanced lifecycles.

---

### ⚖️ 3. **Balance Is the Measure of Truth**  
**Rule**: An idea, force, or system that promotes long-term balance is more true.  
**Purpose**: Shifts away from short-term benefit to universal harmony.  
**Balance Function**: Core of the 25-50-25 framework.

---

### 🔵 4. **Opposites Define Each Other (Duality)**  
**Rule**: Every force or idea is shaped by its opposite: light/dark, cold/hot, motion/stillness.  
**Purpose**: Prevents reductionism and encourages full-spectrum understanding.  
**Balance Function**: Promotes coexistence of tension and harmony.

---

### 🧩 5. **Simplicity Before Complexity**  
**Rule**: The simplest explanation that aligns with balance is preferred.  
**Purpose**: Cuts unnecessary complexity and abstraction.  
**Balance Function**: Favors natural logic paths.

---

### 🌐 6. **Space Is Not Empty**  
**Rule**: The void is a medium — a reservoir of cold energy or structure (not “nothing”).  
**Purpose**: Reorients cosmology around flow, not vacuum.  
**Balance Function**: Guides understanding of the hidden balance fields (e.g., cold fuel, gravity flows).

---

### 🌿 7. **Life Is Co-Created With Environment**  
**Rule**: No lifeform stands apart — all exist in mutual exchange with surroundings.  
**Purpose**: Undermines anthropocentric dominance models.  
**Balance Function**: Applies ecological interdependence to all sciences.

---

### 🧠 8. **Truth Grows Through Tension With Logic**  
**Rule**: A claim is not more true by consensus or repetition but by passing logical testing.  
**Purpose**: Defends against dogma and mass error.  
**Balance Function**: Keeps the 25% proven science in check; opens 25% for innovation.

---

### 💡 9. **Unknowns Must Be Honored as Unknown**  
**Rule**: That which is unprovable should be placed outside the logic tree, not erased.  
**Purpose**: Prevents fake certainty; invites humility.  
**Balance Function**: Feeds the “experimental zone” in the logic model.

---

### 🛑 10. **Speculative Science Is Not Core Truth**  
**Rule**: Theories requiring unverifiable layers (e.g., inflation, dark matter) should not dominate foundational teaching.  
**Purpose**: Encourages re-evaluation and rebuild from base truths.  
**Balance Function**: Limits drift from balance in the 25% accepted domain.

---

## 🔲 **Guiding Frame: 25 - 50 - 25**

| Segment | Role |
|--------|------|
| **25%** | Accepted tested truths (but always open to rechecking). |
| **50%** | Filtered by long-term balance logic (the true core). |
| **25%** | Ideas-in-waiting: untested, poetic, speculative, visionary — outside the logic tree, but stored respectfully. |
